# Beauty-Heart
A beauty heart simple code i built as a gift for my lover

# Heart Animation
This project creates a dynamic and responsive heart animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Particles trace a heart shape that pulses and subtly "breaks" or stretches, creating an artistic, fragmented visual effect. The animation automatically adjusts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing.

# Files Included
- index.html: The main HTML file that sets up the canvas element where the animation is drawn. It links to the CSS for styling and the JavaScript for the animation logic.

- style.css: Provides basic styling for the canvas, ensuring it covers the full width and height of the viewport and has a dark background.

- script.js: Contains the core JavaScript logic for generating the heart shape, animating the particles, handling resizing, and creating the "broken" or fragmented effect.

# Features
- Responsive Design: The animation canvas automatically scales to fit the device frame and resizes dynamically when the browser window changes size.

- Particle Tracing: Hundreds of small particles follow a defined heart path, leaving behind a fading trail.

- Pulsing Effect: The heart subtly pulses, creating a dynamic and lifelike movement.

- Fragmented/Broken Effect: Particles are slightly perturbed from their perfect path, leading to a visually "broken" or stretched appearance of the heart, resembling abstract art.

- Performance Optimization: Adjusts particle count and drawing density for mobile devices to ensure smoother performance.

# How to Set Up and Run
- Download/Save Files: Ensure you have all three files (index.html, style.css, script.js) saved in the same directory on your computer.

- Open in Browser: Simply open the index.html file using any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

- The animation should start immediately and automatically adapt to your screen size.
